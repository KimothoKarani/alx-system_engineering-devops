# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This project focuses on fundamental concepts of the Bash shell, including shell initialization files, variables (local, global, and reserved), shell expansions, arithmetic operations, and command aliasing. The goal is to understand how the shell interprets commands, manages its environment, and expands arguments.
